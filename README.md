# LilCryptoDecoder
A simple C++ program that generates every possible decryption of a message using Affine and Irregular Columnar Transposition ciphers. 

Limitations:

Irregular Columnar Transposition works only if the number of characters of the plain text in encr_transposition.txt are divisible by 4, minus 2 characters.
